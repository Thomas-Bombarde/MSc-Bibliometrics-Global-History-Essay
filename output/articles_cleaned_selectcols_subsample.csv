"Government, trusts, and the making of better roads in early nineteenth century England and Wales",NA,TURNPIKE TRUSTS; INFRASTRUCTURE; INVESTMENT; PROVISION; ENGLISH; GROWTH; STATE,"Who develops infrastructure? This paper introduces new data to explain which actors developed better roads in early nineteenth century England and Wales. We find that central Government sponsorship and financing of new roads was limited to 100 miles on sections of the politically important London-Holyhead Road. By comparison non-profit turnpike trusts made almost thirty times more new road mileage by attracting both public and private capital. Although the London-Holyhead Road had the highest quality, most turnpike trust roads were good. By government working with and through trusts, a better road network developed, especially in industrializing areas and along Mail routes."
The last free traders? Interwar trade policy in the Netherlands and Netherlands East Indies,trade discrimination; empire; Indonesia; interwar period; quotas; tariffs; the Netherlands,GREAT-DEPRESSION; PROTECTION; BRITAIN; TARIFFS; DEMAND; FRANCE; SOUTH; ASIA,"There has still been too little detailed work on the protectionism that emerged in the wake of the Great Depression. In this paper we explore the experiences of two countries that have been largely neglected in the literature, the Netherlands and Netherlands East Indies (NEI). How did these traditionally free-trading economies respond to the Depression? We construct a detailed product-level database of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade on the basis of primary sources. While ad valorem tariff increases in the Netherlands were largely due to deflation, the country protected agriculture and textiles in a number of ways. Once quotas are taken into account, trade restrictiveness indices suggest that protection in the Netherlands and NEI was comparable to protection in the UK and India, respectively. The NEI quota system was largely geared to protecting Dutch exporters, and succeeded in doing so, but the reverse was not true."
Systemic Risk and Monetary Policy: The Haircut Gap Channel of the Lender of Last Resort,E44; E52; E58; G01; G21,UNCERTAINTY; STABILITY; CONTAGION; BANKS; SAY,"We show that lender of last resort (LOLR) policy exacerbates bank interconnectedness. Using novel micro-level data, we analyze LOLR's haircut gaps: the differences between the private market and central bank haircuts. LOLR policy incentivizes banks to increase pledging and holdings of higher haircut-gap bonds, especially those issued by domestic and systemically important banks. Effects only apply to banks, not to nonbanks without LOLR access. LOLR funding revives bank bond issuance associated with higher haircut gaps and increases the subsequent correlation between pledging and issuing banks' bond prices, in particular during periods of low-market returns and for domestic, systemically important banks.Authors have furnished an , which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online."
Numeracy and consistency in age declarations: a case study on nineteenth and twentieth century Catalonia,Human capital; Numeracy; Catalonia; Nineteenth century; Twentieth century; Life course; N33; N34; J10,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; SPAIN; INVESTMENT; PRICES; 17TH,"A rich tradition exists on measuring human capital in historical societies through basic mathematical skills using the method of age heaping. In this article, we novelty propose to calculate it also through the analysis of the consistency in individual consecutive age declaration statements in five towns of Baix Llobregat's county (Barcelona, Spain) during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The region underwent a proto-industrialization in the eighteenth century and was one of the main wool and cotton textile producers in the nineteenth century in Catalonia. Our main results show that (I) numeracy levels in this county were above the Spanish average in the whole period and, during the first years of the nineteenth century, ahead of countries such as Italy, Portugal and the USA. However, its numeracy dropped from 1880's due the early industrialization of Catalonia in the Spanish and Southern Europe context, the existence of child labor in the factories and that also coincided with the phylloxera crisis. (II) To this effect, women presented lower levels of numeracy than men, but their levels tended to converge. (III) As regards emigrants, those who came to the rest of Spain had the lowest level of numeracy compared to the natives. (IV) Moreover, we found that literacy, the 1901 education reform and a higher socioeconomic status had a positive effect on reporting ages consistently over time. (V) Finally, we prove a positive association between systematically reporting ages ending in 0 or 5 and having a higher individual error in age statements along the life course."

Scarring through the 1923 German hyperinflation,NA,HEALTH,"I study the link between the 1923 German hyperinflation and health by linking monthly data on the cost-of-living index with monthly infant and cause-specific adult mortality rates in 280 cities. By exploring panel data with a range of fixed effects, I find that hyperinflation boosted mortality rates. The largest increases in mortality came from deaths plausibly linked to deteriorating social conditions over the short term, such as losses from influenza, meningitis, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, and whooping cough. I also rely on children's heights and weights to show that worsening health was related to impaired nutrition. The results are robust to a range of specifications, placebo tests, and Conley standard errors."
