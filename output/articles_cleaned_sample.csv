This paper introduces new data to explain which actors developed better roads in early nineteenth century England and Wales. We find that central Government sponsorship and financing of new roads was limited to 100 miles on sections of the politically important London-Holyhead Road. By comparison non-profit turnpike trusts made almost thirty times more new road mileage by attracting both public and private capital. Although the London-Holyhead Road had the highest quality, most turnpike trust roads were good. By government working with and through trusts, a better road network developed, especially in industrializing areas and along Mail routes.","[Rosevear, Alan] Univ Cambridge, West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9EF, England; [Bogart, Dan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Shaw-Taylor, Leigh] Univ Cambridge, Fac Hist, West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9EF, England",University of Cambridge; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Cambridge,"Rosevear, A (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9EF, England.",rosevear1@aol.com; dbogart@uci.edu; lmws2@cam.ac.uk,NA,"bogart, dan/0000-0002-0011-3190",Leverhulme Trust [RPG-2013-093]; National Science Foundation or NSF [SES-1260699],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); National Science Foundation or NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Data for this paper was created thanks to grants from: (1) the Leverhulme Trust, grant Transport, Urbanization and Economic Development c.1670-1911 (RPG-2013-093) and(2) the National Science Foundation or NSF (SES-1260699), Modelling the Transport Revolution and the Industrial Revolution in England.

In this paper we explore the experiences of two countries that have been largely neglected in the literature, the Netherlands and Netherlands East Indies (NEI). How did these traditionally free-trading economies respond to the Depression? We construct a detailed product-level database of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade on the basis of primary sources. While ad valorem tariff increases in the Netherlands were largely due to deflation, the country protected agriculture and textiles in a number of ways. Once quotas are taken into account, trade restrictiveness indices suggest that protection in the Netherlands and NEI was comparable to protection in the UK and India, respectively. The NEI quota system was largely geared to protecting Dutch exporters, and succeeded in doing so, but the reverse was not true.","[de Zwart, Pim] Wageningen Univ, Econ & Environm Hist Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lampe, Markus] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Econ & Social Hist, Vienna, Austria; [O'Rourke, Kevin Hjortshoj] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Dept Econ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",Wageningen University & Research; Vienna University of Economics & Business; New York University Abu Dhabi,"de Zwart, P (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Econ & Environm Hist Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",pim.dezwart@wur.nl,"LAMPE, MARKUS/A-3308-2012; O'Rourke, Kevin/B-5927-2008","LAMPE, MARKUS/0000-0002-0859-5091; O'Rourke, Kevin/0000-0001-6272-2090","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; Alan de Bromhead; Dutch Research Council (NWO) [1830-1940, 275-53-016]; Inequality in Southeast Asia; ERC, under the European Union [249546]; ERC","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Alan de Bromhead; Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Inequality in Southeast Asia; ERC, under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC))","We are grateful to Aryaan Bovenberg, Alan de Bromhead, Elisabeth Drahoss, Anders Mikkelsen, and Josje Schuttinga for valuable research assistance.

Using novel micro-level data, we analyze LOLR's haircut gaps: the differences between the private market and central bank haircuts. LOLR policy incentivizes banks to increase pledging and holdings of higher haircut-gap bonds, especially those issued by domestic and systemically important banks. Effects only apply to banks, not to nonbanks without LOLR access. LOLR funding revives bank bond issuance associated with higher haircut gaps and increases the subsequent correlation between pledging and issuing banks' bond prices, in particular during periods of low-market returns and for domestic, systemically important banks.Authors have furnished an , which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.","[Jasova, Martina] Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Laeven, Luc] Tilburg Univ, European Cent Bank, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Laeven, Luc; Peydro, Jose-Luis] CEPR, Paris, France; [Mendicino, Caterina] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Peydro, Jose-Luis] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Peydro, Jose-Luis] Univ Pompeu Fabra, ICREA, BSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Supera, Dominik] Columbia Business Sch, Columbia, MO USA",Columbia University; European Central Bank; Tilburg University; European Central Bank; Imperial College London; ICREA; Pompeu Fabra University,"Jasova, M (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA.",mjasova@barnard.edu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,51,0,0,13,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,NA,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

In this article, we novelty propose to calculate it also through the analysis of the consistency in individual consecutive age declaration statements in five towns of Baix Llobregat's county (Barcelona, Spain) during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The region underwent a proto-industrialization in the eighteenth century and was one of the main wool and cotton textile producers in the nineteenth century in Catalonia. Our main results show that (I) numeracy levels in this county were above the Spanish average in the whole period and, during the first years of the nineteenth century, ahead of countries such as Italy, Portugal and the USA. However, its numeracy dropped from 1880's due the early industrialization of Catalonia in the Spanish and Southern Europe context, the existence of child labor in the factories and that also coincided with the phylloxera crisis. (II) To this effect, women presented lower levels of numeracy than men, but their levels tended to converge. (III) As regards emigrants, those who came to the rest of Spain had the lowest level of numeracy compared to the natives. (IV) Moreover, we found that literacy, the 1901 education reform and a higher socioeconomic status had a positive effect on reporting ages consistently over time. (V) Finally, we prove a positive association between systematically reporting ages ending in 0 or 5 and having a higher individual error in age statements along the life course.","[Pujadas-Mora, Joana Maria] Open Univ Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain; [Pujadas-Mora, Joana Maria] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Demog Studies, Barcelona, Spain; [Perez-Artes, Maria Carmen] Univ Almeria, Dept Econ & Business, Res Grp HEDES SEJ 667 & Mediterranean Res Ctr Econ, Almeria, Spain",UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centre d'Estudis Demografics (CED); Universidad de Almeria,"Pujadas-Mora, JM (corresponding author), Open Univ Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain.;Pujadas-Mora, JM (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Ctr Demog Studies, Barcelona, Spain.",jpujadasmo@uoc.edu; mcarmenartes@ual.es,"; Pujadas-Mora, Joana Maria/L-8839-2015","Perez Artes, Maria del Carmen/0000-0001-6835-9771; Pujadas-Mora, Joana Maria/0000-0002-4975-639X",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PID2021-1280100B-I00],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"The authors would like to thank the financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation: Project PID2021-1280100B-I00.

The largest increases in mortality came from deaths plausibly linked to deteriorating social conditions over the short term, such as losses from influenza, meningitis, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, and whooping cough. I also rely on children's heights and weights to show that worsening health was related to impaired nutrition.
